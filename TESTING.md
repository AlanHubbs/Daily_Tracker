‚ñ° Clear all tasks and start fresh
```

#### 2. Visual & Interactions

## üîÑ Testing Workflow

### For Each Branch Merge

1. **Pre-Merge Testing**
   ```bash
   # On main branch
   open test-suite.html
   # Run all tests, note baseline results
   ```

2. **Create Test Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/merge-[feature-name]
   git merge origin/feature/[feature-name]
   ```

3. **Post-Merge Testing**
   ```bash
   open test-suite.html
   # Run all tests again
   # Complete manual checklist for the feature
   ```

4. **Fix Issues**
   - Resolve any test failures
   - Fix merge conflicts
   - Update test suite if new features added

5. **Final Verification**
   ```bash
   # Clear browser data
   # Test fresh install experience
   # Test with existing data
   ```

6. **Merge to Main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge test/merge-[feature-name]
   git push
   ```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Test Failures

#### "LocalStorage not available"
- Check browser privacy settings
- Disable incognito/private mode
- Clear browser data and retry

#### "Feature not detected"
- Feature may not be merged yet
- Check if feature files are loaded
- Verify merge was successful

#### "Task operations failing"
- Clear localStorage and retry
- Check for data structure changes
- Verify date formatting is correct

### Merge Conflicts

#### Multiple Settings Modals
- Consolidate into single settings panel
- Merge notification settings with other settings

#### Duplicate Functions
- Keep single definition of `getTaskXP()`
- Remove redundant helper functions

#### State Management
- Ensure all AppState properties are included
- Merge settings objects carefully

## üìä Test Coverage Goals

### Minimum Coverage for Release
- ‚úÖ 100% Core Functionality Tests Pass
- ‚úÖ 90% Feature Tests Pass (for merged features)
- ‚úÖ 100% PWA Tests Pass
- ‚úÖ No Critical UI/UX Issues

### Performance Benchmarks
- Page load: < 1 second
- Task creation: Instant (< 100ms)
- Animation FPS: 60 FPS
- LocalStorage operations: < 50ms

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Browser DevTools
```javascript
// Check localStorage data
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('daily_tracker_data')));

// Check settings
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('daily_tracker_settings')));

// Test task creation
const testTask = {
    id: 'debug_' + Date.now(),
    title: 'Debug Task',
    priority: 'high',
    createdAt: Date.now(),
    completedAt: null,
    dateAssigned: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
};
```

### Service Worker Debugging
1. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Application tab
2. Check Service Workers section
3. Click "Update" to refresh worker
4. Check "Offline" to test offline mode

### PWA Installation Testing
1. Open Chrome ‚Üí Three dots menu
2. Look for "Install Daily_Tracker..."
3. Check desktop for installed app
