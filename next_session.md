## 🔧 Quick Testing Checklist

Before continuing development, verify these work:
- [ ] Create a new task
- [ ] Mark task as complete (see confetti)
- [ ] Delete a task
- [ ] XP bar updates
- [ ] Streak counter works
- [ ] Tasks persist after page reload
- [ ] Drag and drop reordering
- [ ] Sort mode toggle (Auto/Manual)

## 📝 Architecture Notes

### Current Module Structure
The app uses IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) pattern for modular JavaScript:
- Single `AppState` object for state management
- Functions for task CRUD operations
- Event delegation for performance
- LocalStorage for persistence

### Data Storage Keys
- `daily_tracker_data` - Tasks, XP, streaks
- `daily_tracker_settings` - User preferences

### Future Considerations
- Consider refactoring to ES6 modules if app grows
- May need IndexedDB for large data sets
- WebWorker for heavy analytics calculations
- Consider state management library if complexity increases
