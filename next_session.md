# Daily_Tracker - Next Session Brief

## 📋 Project Summary

**Daily_Tracker** is a gamified PWA task management application built as a single HTML file with offline support. The project is now live on GitHub at https://github.com/AlanHubbs/Daily_Tracker.

### Current Status
- ✅ **Core Functionality**: Basic task CRUD operations working
- ✅ **Gamification**: XP system, streak counter, confetti animations
- ✅ **PWA Ready**: Service worker and manifest configured
- ✅ **GitHub**: Repository created and code pushed
- ⏳ **GitHub Pages**: Needs to be enabled for live demo

### What's Working
1. Create, complete, and delete tasks
2. Priority system (Low/Med/High)
3. XP and streak tracking
4. Confetti animations on task completion
5. Sound effects (Web Audio API)
6. Basic drag-and-drop support
7. Auto vs Manual sorting modes
8. LocalStorage persistence
9. Service Worker for offline capability

### What's Not Yet Implemented
Based on the specification (`daily-tracker-spec.md`), these features are still needed:

#### High Priority
1. **Task Groups/Templates** - Reusable task templates
2. **Recurring Tasks** - Daily, weekly, monthly recurrence
3. **Search & Filters** - Text search, status/priority filtering
4. **Settings Panel** - Theme toggle, sound controls, notifications
5. **Task Editing** - In-place editing of task titles
6. **Task Notes** - Additional details for tasks

#### Medium Priority
7. **History & Analytics** - Day/week/month views with stats
8. **Notifications** - PWA notifications at scheduled times
9. **Data Import/Export** - JSON backup/restore
10. **Privacy Mode** - Blur task titles for screen sharing
11. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Full implementation (N, G, Cmd+K, etc.)

#### Low Priority
12. **PWA Icons** - Need actual icon files (currently placeholders)
13. **Achievement System** - Unlock badges for milestones
14. **Print/PDF Export** - Daily checklist printing
15. **Demo Data Loader** - Load sample data for testing

  - UX requirements
  - Keyboard shortcuts specification

### 3. **docs/PLAN.md** (Implementation Plan)
- **Location**: `/docs/PLAN.md`
- **Review Focus**:
  - 6-week development timeline
  - Detailed implementation phases
  - Architecture decisions
  - Testing strategy

### 4. **demo/demo-data.json** (Test Data)
- **Location**: `/demo/demo-data.json`

## 🚀 Recommended Next Session Goals

### Session 1: Core Features
1. **Implement Task Groups/Templates**
   - UI for creating/managing groups
   - Quick-add from template functionality

   - Edit modal or inline editing

### Session 2: Recurring Tasks
1. **Build Recurrence Engine**
   - Pattern definitions (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Auto-generation at midnight
   - Recurrence rule management UI

### Session 3: Settings & Preferences
1. **Create Settings Panel**
   - Modal or sidebar design
   - Theme switcher (light/dark)
   - Sound controls
   - Notification preferences
   - Privacy mode toggle

### Session 4: Search & Analytics
1. **Implement Search/Filter System**
   - Real-time search
   - Filter buttons/dropdowns
   - Combined search and filter logic

2. **Build Analytics Dashboard**
   - History view with calendar
   - Statistics and charts
   - Streak history

## 💻 Development Setup for Next Session

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/alanhubbs/Documents/Daily_Tracker

# Open in browser for testing
open index.html

# Check git status
git status

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

## 🔧 Quick Testing Checklist

Before continuing development, verify these work:
- [ ] Create a new task
- [ ] Mark task as complete (see confetti)
- [ ] Delete a task
- [ ] XP bar updates
- [ ] Streak counter works
- [ ] Tasks persist after page reload
- [ ] Drag and drop reordering
- [ ] Sort mode toggle (Auto/Manual)

## 📝 Architecture Notes

### Current Module Structure
The app uses IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) pattern for modular JavaScript:
- Single `AppState` object for state management
- Functions for task CRUD operations
- Event delegation for performance
- LocalStorage for persistence

### Data Storage Keys
- `daily_tracker_data` - Tasks, XP, streaks
- `daily_tracker_settings` - User preferences

### Future Considerations
- Consider refactoring to ES6 modules if app grows
- May need IndexedDB for large data sets
- WebWorker for heavy analytics calculations
- Consider state management library if complexity increases

## 🎯 Definition of Done for v1.0

Core features that must work before considering v1.0 complete:
1. ✅ Basic task management (CRUD)
2. ⬜ Task groups/templates
3. ⬜ Recurring tasks
4. ⬜ Search and filters
5. ⬜ Settings panel with theme toggle
6. ⬜ Data import/export
7. ✅ PWA installation
8. ⬜ Notifications (at least permission request)
